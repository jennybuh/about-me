- 👋 Hi, I’m Jennifer! My friends and family call me Jen.

- 🌍 I completed Google's Data Analytics certification in 2021 with the goal of starting my career as a data analyst. 
I'm excited to build on my B.S. in Environmental studies. Qualitative and quantitative reesearch methods, critical thinking, creative problem solving, and the ability to consider the big picture and pay attention to the small details are some of the most valuable skills I obtained from my bachelor's degree. I'm excited to apply that to my work as a data analyst.

- 👀 I’m most interested in solving on real world pressing in the sustainability field for just about any sector (energy, resource management, business, etc.).

- 🌱 I currently use Excel, SQL, and Tableau in my data analysis projects. I plan to learn Python, and build upon my knowledge of R this year.
