ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Jennifer! My friends and family call me Jen -- it saves them a couple of syllables.

I've worked in the healthcare insurance industry for 5 years, currently serving as a Business Analyst. In this role, I leverage my analytical experience and background in research and science to propose strategic solutions for my team and stakeholders. My work involves analyzing data to identify trends, improving our analysis processes, and support data-driven decision-making.

ðŸ‘€ I'm passionate about solving complex problems, especially in sustainability and the healthcare field, but I welcome challenges from any industry or subject. I'm deeply confident my analytical skills allow me to tackle diverse issues and deliver actionable insights.

I also consider myself to be a curious scientist at heart, I hope you'll see this through some of my research papers!

**Technical Background:**


I completed Google's Data Analytics certification in 2021 after becoming captivated by the technologies the field brings to data analysis. 
I'm excited to apply languages and tools like **SQL, Tableau, and Excel** to complement my educational background. In my studies, I applied qualitative and quantitative reesearch methods, data analysis fundamentals, and critical thinking, to provide data-backed proposals, for real-world problems.

ðŸŒ± Outside of work, I am continually expanding my skill set through online courses and personal projects. 

I'm currently expanding my knowledge on:

  - **Tableau:** The Complete Tableau Bootcamp for Data Visualization @ _Udemy_
  - **Python:** Python Basics @ _Coursera, University of Michigan_
  - **SQL:** SQL Problems @ _DataLemur_
