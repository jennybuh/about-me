- 👋 Hi, I’m Jennifer! My friends and family call me Jen.

- 🌍 I recently completed Google's Data Analytics certification with the goal of jump starting my career as a data analyst. 
I'm excited to build on my B.S. in Environmental studies. Qualitative and quantitative reesearch methods, critical thinking, creative problem solving, and the ability to consider the big picture and pay attention to the small details are some of the most valuable skills I obtained from my bachelor's degree. I'm excited to apply that to my work as a data analyst.

- 👀 I’m most interested in solving on real world pressing in the sustainability field for just about any sector (energy, resource management, business, etc.).
But as a junior / entry data analyst, I'm really to take on any opportunity that will challenge and grow my skillset.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Tableau, and R in that order of priority.
