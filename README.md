- 👋 Hi, I’m Jennifer! My friends and family call me Jen.

- 🌍 I recently completed Google's Data Analytics certification with the goal of jump starting my career as a data analyst. 
I'm excited to build on my B.S. in Environmental studies, where I gained and fostered my research, writing, and critical thinking skills.

- 👀 I’m most interested in solving on real world pressing in the sustainability field for just about any sector (energy, resource management, business, etc.).
But as a junior / entry data analyst, I'm glad to take on any opportunity that will challenge and grow my skillset.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Tableau, and R in that order of priority.
